## **1. User Experience (UX)**

### **1.1 Target Audience**

####  This website is aimed at anyone who:

* Is interested in reading information on recorded UFO phenomenon. 

### **1.2 Visitor goals** 

* To allow visitors to the site to search for recorded UFO phenomenon by a particular geographical area (currently limited to the UK). Users can also view UFO videos, UFO imagery, and read a sample of free to read UFO reports.  

### **1.3 Business goals**

* The site provides some information for free to users. To access all of the 7,000+ recorded files users are required to have paid subscription.

### **1.4 User Stories**

As a visitor to the company website i expect/want/need

### **1.5 Design choices** 

I wanted the project to have a serious feel and to be credible. We are using official data from the British Ministry of Defense and we wanted the design choices to reflect the credibility of the site. I wanted to use lots of great imagery throughout the site so it gave a positive user experience. I didn't want lots of clutter on the pages as this can be common with websites for this type of business. I also wanted the site to be easy to navigate.

#### FONTS

* I decided i would use the Google font [Montserrat Alternates](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates?query=Montserrat+Alternates&preview.text=This%20is%20how%20the%20font%20is%20displayed&preview.text_type=custom) for this project. I chose this font as it is a modern font and has that clean minimalist look i wanted. It looks well on both mobile and desktop devices. 

![Image of message received successfully page](./assets/images/readme_images/google_font_used.png)

#### ICONS

* The majority of the icons i have used on the site have come from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) I made use of icons because they make a site look better and also give the user an idea of the type of information that they are looking at.

#### COLORS

* The bulk of the site is made up of full page background imagery. This was done intentionally so each page has its own feel without needing to do a lot of CSS to achieve this. The colors that we did use throughout the site were:

* #000000 - Black
* #ffffff - White 
* #0000008c - Grey

## **2. Features**

### **2.1 The Navbar**

<!-- Need to add this image -->
![Image of Navbar]()

* The Navbar i used is a standard Bootstrap 5 Navbar. The menu items in the Navbar may change over time, but the currentl ones we have are: 

1. About Us
2. UFO Footage 
3. UFO Images 
4. UFO Reports
5. Contact Us
6. More (A drop down menu which contains the F.A.Q page and the Terms of Use page)
7. Subscribe 

The site also needed to be mobile responsive, this is the main reason i chose Bootstrap for this project as it provided me with a quick and easy way of achieving this. On smaller screen sizes the navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu that when clicked will expand and reveal the nav bar items.

* The footer is a standard basic footer that just lists the copyright to ARCHI Information Systems and also lists myself as the developer.
