## **1. User Experience (UX)**

### **1.1 Target Audience**

####  This website is aimed at anyone who:

* Is interested in reading information on recorded UFO phenomenon, viewing UFO images or watching UFO Video footage. 

### **1.2 Visitor goals** 

* To be able to to search for recorded UFO phenomenon by a particular geographical area (currently limited to the UK). I also want to be able to view the UFO Images, the UFO Footage, read the free to read UFO reports, sign up for a paid subscription and to contact the site admin if needed.  

### **1.3 Business goals**

* The site provides some information for free to users, however to access all of the 7,000+ recorded files users are required to have paid subscription. The business goal of the site is to drive paid subscriptions.

### **1.4 User Stories**

As a visitor to the company website i expect/want/need

### **1.5 Design choices** 

I wanted the project to have a serious feel and to be credible. We are using official data from the British Ministry of Defense (MoD) and we wanted the design choices to reflect the credibility of the site. I wanted to use lots of great imagery throughout the site so it gave a positive user experience. I didn't want lots of clutter on the pages as this can be common with websites of this type. The site also had to be easy to navigate.

#### FONTS

* I decided i would use the Google font [Montserrat Alternates](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates?query=Montserrat+Alternates&preview.text=This%20is%20how%20the%20font%20is%20displayed&preview.text_type=custom) for this project. I chose this font as it is a modern font and has that clean minimalist look i wanted. It looks well on both mobile and desktop devices. 

![Image of message received successfully page](./assets/images/readme_images/google_font_used.png)

#### ICONS

* The majority of the icons i have used on the site have come from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) I made use of icons because they make a site look better and also give the user an idea of the type of information that they are looking at.

#### COLORS

* The bulk of the site is made up of full page background imagery. This was done intentionally so each page has its own feel without needing to do a lot of CSS to achieve this. The colors that we did use throughout the site were:

1. Black<br>
![Black Color Used](./assets/images/readme_images/black_readme.png)

2. White<br>

## **2. Features**

### **2.1 The Navbar**

![Image of Navbar](./assets/images/readme_images/navbar_desktop.png)

* The Navbar i used is a standard Bootstrap 5 Navbar. The menu items in the Navbar may change over time, but the current ones we have are: 

1. About Us
2. UFO Footage 
3. UFO Images 
4. UFO Reports
5. Contact Us
6. More (A drop down menu which contains the F.A.Q page and the Terms of Use page)
7. Subscribe 

* The site also needed to be mobile responsive, this is the main reason i chose Bootstrap for this project as it provided me with a quick and easy way of achieving this. On smaller screen sizes the navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu that when clicked will expand and reveal the nav bar items. 

![Image of Navbar as a hamburger menu opened](./assets/images/readme_images/navbar_opened_mobile.png)
